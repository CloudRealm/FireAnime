<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
Fire Anime is an Android Application that collects Anime links from 3rd Party sites and lets users view content from those links. I do not host or have access to any of the anime that is posted on these 3rd party sites.
We are not Responsible for the content hosted on these sites. For legal issues, contact the appropriate host site.

<h2>UsageData</h2>
For now this Application dosent collect any information from the user who uses this app.
The Anime that you have saved on your watch list is saved to your specific device and not a server so i cant collect any data.
The only time this is exempt is when you make a specific search for an Anime as it searches the specific anime on a server which may be recorded by your ISP.

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

<h4>This app is 100% free and I do not charge to use this Application</h4>
